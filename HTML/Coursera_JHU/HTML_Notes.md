## HTML Tag

#### Overview

```<p>content</p> ```

here ```<p>``` is opening tag and ```</p>``` is closing tag, ```p``` itself is called element. But the truth is the term is used interchangeably now. So **element** and **tag** are usually mean the same thing.



#### Not all tags has closing tag

For example, like ```<br>``` and ```<hr>``` don't have a closing tag.



#### Attributes of element

```<p id = "myId"></p>```

* Attribute is a neme value pair that is kind of a meta data abou the element itself.
* Attribute can only be specified on the opening tag.
* "id" attribute is unique, and each attribute will have its own rule



#### Self-Closing tag

```<p/>``` 

A self-closing tag is basically an XML type of shorthand notation for a tag that happens to not to contain any content. (Placeholder).

But in HTML5, it's illegal for the tag to be self closing, even though there is no content at the moment.
